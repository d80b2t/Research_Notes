\begin{abstract}
This is a simple document which will give some overviews, NPR-style
notes and general things-to-remember for {\tt Docker}. Docker is an
open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run
distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the
cloud.

\section{Docker}

Purpose: This document is a place where we/I (NPR) will keep notes on
how to use Docker \href{https://www.docker.com/}{\tt
(https://www.docker.com/}.\\

\noindent
``Docker is the world's leading software containerization platform''.\\

\noindent
``Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.''\\


Definition (from,of course Wikipedia): 
Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.  

Operating-system-level virtualization is a server virtualization method in which the kernel of an operating system allows the existence of multiple isolated user-spaceinstances, instead of just one. Such instances, which are sometimes called containers, software containers,[1] virtualization engines (VEs) or jails (FreeBSD jail or chroot jail), may look and feel like a real server from the point of view of its owners and users.

{\tt User\_space:} A modern computer operating system usually segregates virtual memory into kernel space and user space.[a] Primarily, this separation serves to provide memory protection and hardware protection from malicious or errant software behaviour.
Kernel space is strictly reserved for running a privileged operating system kernel, kernel extensions, and most device drivers. In contrast, user space is the memory area where application software and some drivers execute.

\begin{itemize}					
\item{Layer - a set of read-only les to provision the system.}
\item{Image - a read-only layer that is the base of your container. Might have a parent image.}
\item{Container - a runnable instance of the image.}
\item{Registry / Hub - central place where images live.}
\item{Docker machine - a VM to run Docker containers (Linux does this natively).}
\item{Docker compose - a utility to run multiple containers as a system.}
