%% Some reasonable list is below, and I add some links to a
%% Specialization where you can learn about those algorithms/data
%% structures and practice solving problems - they don’t cover
%% everything, but they cover a lot, and there are around 80 problems on
%% those topics.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{General techniques: greedy algorithms, dynamic programming - dozens of techniques, divide-and-conquer (binary search and other), sorting algorithms - especially merge sort, heap sort and quick sort, partial sort/top-k elements in [expected] linear time.}

\item{Data structures: arrays, dynamic arrays, stacks, queues, deques, trees, heaps, hash functions and hash tables including rolling hash/polynomial hash for strings/substrings, binary search trees (treap or splay, including the one with implicit keys), segment trees/Fenwick tree, disjoint set union, sqrt-decomposition.}

\item{Graphs: exploration - DFS/BFS, shortest paths - {\bf Dijkstra}, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, spanning trees - {\bf Prim’s}, Kruskal’s, flows - Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, min-cost-max-flow, topological sort and strongly connected components, 2-SAT, LCA, bridges and articulation points, eulerian cycle, biconnected graphs - 2-coloring, matching.}

\item{Strings: KMP, Z-function, polynomial rolling hash, suffix array, suffix tree or suffix automaton.}

\item{Algebra/Number Theory: Euclid’s algorithm, fast exponentiation, sieve of Eratosthenes, inverse modulo prime number, solving ax+by=c and alike Diophantine equations, Euler’s function computation, Fast Fourier Transform, Gauss’s algorithm for matrix inversion/solving system of linear equations, chinese theorem about remainders.}

\item{Geometry: intersecting lines, segments, circles, line and polygon, tangents and common tangents, moving points, lines and segments, sorting by angle, computing lengths and areas, convex hull, scanning line algorithms, fast point inside polygon, finding two closest/farthest points, covering circle.}

\item{Various: number of combinations, Catalan’s numbers, inclusion-exclusion formula, Burnside’s lemma, Stirling numbers, Grundy numbers for games.}
