\section{Introduction}
From Wikipedia,  
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Machine_learning&oldid=753193210}{retrieved, Mon Dec  5 16:28:49 PST 2016}: \\

Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that "gives
computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"
(Arthur Samuel, 1959). Evolved from the study of pattern recognition
and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine
learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can
learn from and make predictions on data â€“ such algorithms overcome
following strictly static program instructions by making data driven
predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample
inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks
where designing and programming explicit algorithms is unfeasible;
example applications include spam filtering, detection of network
intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach, optical
character recognition (OCR), search engines and computer vision.\\


\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
Broadly, there are 3 types of Machine Learning Algorithms:

\noindent
1. Supervised Learning\\
2. Unsupervised Learning\\
3. Reinforcement Learning\\
