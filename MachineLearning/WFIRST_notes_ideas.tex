How well can you get actual redshifts for WFIRST QSOs???

grism + photo-z 

z=6-7  actually only CIV in WFIRST 
z=3-6 actually only MgII in WFIRST 

only at v high redshift do you get LyA into WFIRST (grism...)



Where are you getting the imaging data from to point
JWST to v. high-z QSOs??


How many galaxies will DESI and Euclid overlap with??


W1W2drops from AllWISE (from Peter Eisenhardt discussion...)
