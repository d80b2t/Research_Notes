\begin{abstract}
This is a simple document which will hopefully\/eventually be a pretty
complete list/glossary of various (astro)Physical terms and `what they
mean'. There will be some overlap here with my other Research Notes,
e.g. the Emission Line document...
\end{abstract}

\section{A}
\subsection{Advection Dominated Accretion Flows}
%% www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~dhw/A825/notes5.pdf
The Eddington accretion rate is the accretion rate for which the black
hole radiates at the Eddington luminosity:
\begin{equation} 
    \dot{M}_{\rm Edd} = L_{\rm Edd} /\epsilon c^{2}.
\end{equation} 
It is generally thought that when the accretion rate is $\sim0.01-11
\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ thin disk accretion is a reasonable approximation.
With a high accretion rate, the gas density is high, so the gas is
able to radiate efficiently and stay geometrically thin.

However, if the gas density is low, the gas may be unable to radiate
energy at a rate that balances viscous heating.  In this case, the
heat generated by viscosity will be ``advected'' inwards with the flow
instead of being radiated. The disk becomes hot, hence geometrically
thick (though perhaps optically thin), hence low density, and
radiatively inefficient.  Such ``Advection Dominated Accretion Flows''
(ADAFs) were studied by Lightman \& Eardley, Rees, and others in the
1970s. They were revived in the 1990s by the work of Narayan \& Yi and
others.

%% Narayan_Mahadevan_Quataert_9803141v1
At super–Eddington accretion rates, in which the large optical depth
of the inflowing gas traps most of the radiation and carries it
inward, or “advects” it, into the central black hole. This solution is
referred to as an optically thick advection–dominated accretion flow
(optically thick ADAF).

\section{B}
    \subsection{Bondi Accretion}
    % astro.physics.uiowa.edu/~kaaret/heastro10s/L12_agn.pdf
    % From Wikipedia (2017-09-13)::  
    BA is spherical accretion onto a compact object traveling through
the interstellar medium. It is generally used in the context of
neutron star and black hole accretion. To achieve an approximate form
of the Bondi accretion rate, accretion is assumed to occur at a rate
\begin{equation}
  \dot {M}\simeq \pi R^{2}\rho v
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the ambient density, $v$ is either the velocity of the
object or the sound speed $ c_{s}$ in the surrounding medium if the
object's velocity is lower than the sound speed, and the Bondi radius
$R$ provides an effective area. The effective radius is acquired by
equating the object's escape velocity and the relevant speed, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{R}} \simeq c_s, 
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
  R\simeq\frac{2 G M}{c_s^2}.
\end{equation}
The accretion rate therefore becomes
\begin{equation}
\dot {M} \simeq \frac{\pi \rho G^{2}M^{2}}{c_{s}^{3}} .
\end{equation}
These are only scaling relations rather than rigorous definitions. A
more complete solution can be found in Bondi's original work and two
other papers.

AGN Accrete from the ISM, Via Bondi accretion:
    \begin{equation}
      \dot{M} \simeq (1.4\times10^{11} \rm{g/s}) \left( \frac{M}{M_{\Theta}} \right) \left( \frac{\rho}{10^{-24}\ \rm{g / cm^{3}}} \right)  \left( \frac{c_s}{10 \rm{km/s}} \right)^{-3}
    \end{equation}
 $M_{\Theta}$ should be $M_{\odot}$??!!

    
    \subsection{BPT diagram}
    Straight from:\href{http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Glossary/Essay_bpt.html}{Level 5 BPT}
    
    ``Baldwin, Phillips \& Terlevich'' (BPT) diagrams demonstrate how LINERs can be distinguished from normal H II regions and normal AGNs (Seyferts and QSOs) on the basis of their [O III] $\lambda$5007 / H$\beta$, [N II] $\lambda$6583 / H$\alpha$, and [S II] $\lambda \lambda$6716, 6731 / H$\alpha$ flux ratios. Here it is seen that the Seyfert 2s have high values of each ratio. H II regions define a locus of lower values which does not overlap with the region of parameter space occupied by the Seyferts. The LINERs can be distinguished from the Seyfert 2s by their low values of [O III] $\lambda$5007 / H$\beta$ relative to [N II] $\lambda$6583 / H$\alpha$, and from the H II regions by their larger values of [N II] $\lambda$6583 / H$\alpha$.

    [O III]/[O II] is sensitive to ionization parameter (how ionized is the gas).
    [O I]/ H $\alpha$ is sensitive to hardness of the radiation field. 
    
    
\section{C}

    \subsection{Covering Factor}
    From \citet[e.g.,][]{Roseboom13}...
``The fraction of sight-lines to the AGN centre obscured by dust.''

    \subsection{Comption Thick}
    Straight from: \href{http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March04/Comastri/frames.html}{Comastri,  astro-ph/0403693}.
    
    The spectrum of the hard X-ray background records the history of
    accretion processes integrated over the cosmic time. Several pieces of
    observational and theoretical evidence indicate that a significant
    fraction of the energy density is obscured by large columns of gas and
    dust. The absorbing matter is often very thick, {\bf with column densities
      exceeding $N_{\rm H} \simeq 1.5 \times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, the value corresponding to unity
      optical depth for Compton scattering}. These sources are called
    "Compton thick" and appear to be very numerous, at least in the nearby
    universe. Although Compton thick Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are
    thought to provide an important contribution to the overall cosmic
    energy budget, their space density and cosmological evolution are
    poorly known. The properties of Compton thick AGN are reviewed here,
    with particular emphasis on their contributions to the extragalactic
    background light in the hard X-ray and infrared bands.
    
\section{D}
    \subsection{Duty cycle}
    ``the fraction of the time that an AGN/QSO is active.''


\section{L}
\subsection{LINERS}
Straight from Sturm et al., 2006, ApJL, 653, L13:\\
Since their identification as a class of galactic nuclei more than 25
years ago (Heckman 1980), the nature of low-ionization nuclear
emission-line regions (LINERs) has remained controversial. Their
optical spectra are characterized by enhanced narrow emission lines
of low-ionization species, quite distinct from those of both {H~\sc{ii}} 
regions and classical active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They are found in
one-third to one-half of all types nearby galaxies (e.g., Ho et
al. 1997). In many LINERs the emission is concentrated near the
nucleus (a few times 100 pc; e.g., Pogge et al. 2000), but in others
it extends over larger regions, up to a few kiloparsecs (Veilleux et
al. 1995). There is substantial evidence that many LINERs are powered
by accretion onto massive black holes and that these objects, due to
low accretion rates, constitute the low-luminosity end of the AGN
class (Quataert 2001; Kewley et al. 2006). If many LINERs at low and
high redshifts are indeed low-luminosity AGNs, this would have a
significant impact on major issues in astronomy such as the growth
history of central black holes and the relation of AGNs to galaxy
formation and evolution.

\section{R}
\subsection{Reddening}

\subsection{Rosseland opacities}
(from scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/RosselandMeanOpacity.html) \\   	
The Rosseland mean opacity $\langle \kappa \rangle$  is defined as
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\kappa} = \frac{1}{B} \int^{\infty}_{0} \frac{B_{\nu}}{\kappa_{\nu}} d\nu
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the total brightness (intensity), $B_{\nu}$ is the
specific brightness, and $\kappa_{\nu}$ is the specific opacity. \\

\noindent
(from Wikipedia) \\
It is customary to define the average opacity, calculated using a
certain weighting scheme. Planck opacity uses the normalized Planck
black body radiation energy density distribution, $B_{\nu }(T)$ as the
weighting function, and averages $\kappa _{\nu}$ directly:
\begin{eqnarray}
\kappa _{Pl} & =& {\int _{0}^{\infty }\kappa _{\nu }B_{\nu }(T)d\nu \over
                  \int _{0}^{\infty }B_{\nu }(T)d\nu } \\ 
                 & = &{\Big (}{\pi \over \sigma
                  T^{4}}{\Big )}\int _{0}^{\infty }\kappa _{\nu }B_{\nu }(T)d\nu ,
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent
where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\\ 

\noindent
The Rosseland opacity (after Svein Rosseland), on the other hand, uses a
temperature derivative of the Planck distribution,$u(\nu ,T)=\partial
B_{\nu }(T)/\partial T$ as the weighting function, and averages $\kappa
_{\nu }^{-1}$,
\begin{equation}
\frac  {1}{\kappa} =\frac  {\int _{0}^{{\infty }}\kappa _{{\nu }}^{{-1}}u(\nu ,T)d\nu }{\int _{0}^{{\infty }}u(\nu ,T)d\nu}.
\end{equation}
\noindent
The photon mean free path is $\lambda _{\nu }=(\kappa _{\nu }\rho
)^{-1}$. The Rosseland opacity is derived in the diffusion
approximation to the radiative transport equation. It is valid
whenever the radiation field is isotropic over distances comparable to
or less than a radiation mean free path, such as in local thermal
equilibrium. In practice, the mean opacity for Thomson electron
scattering is:
\begin{equation}
\kappa _{{{\rm {es}}}}=0.20(1+X){{\rm {\,cm}}}^{2}{{\rm {\,g}}}^{{-1}}
\end{equation}
\noindent
where $X$ is the hydrogen mass fraction. For nonrelativistic thermal
bremsstrahlung, or free-free transitions, assuming solar metallicity,
it is:
\begin{equation}
\kappa _{{{\rm {ff}}}}(\rho ,T)=0.64\times 10^{{23}}(\rho [{{\rm {g}}}~{{\rm {\,cm}}}^{{-3}}])(T[{{\rm {K}}}])^{{-7/2}}{{\rm {\,cm}}}^{2}{{\rm {\,g}}}^{{-1}}.[1]
\end{equation}

\noindent
The Rosseland mean attenuation coefficient is:
\begin{equation}
{\frac  {1}{\kappa }}={\frac  {\int _{0}^{{\infty }}(\kappa _{{\nu ,{{\rm {es}}}}}+\kappa _{{\nu ,{{\rm {ff}}}}})^{{-1}}u(\nu ,T)d\nu }{\int _{0}^{{\infty }}u(\nu ,T)d\nu }}]
\end{equation}


\section{S}
\subsection{Salpeter time}
\begin{equation}
  t_{S} = M/\dot{M} = 4.5 \times10^{7} \left( \frac{\epsilon}{0.1}\right ) \left( \frac{L}{L_{\rm Edd}}\right )^{-1}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon = L/\dot{M} c^{2}$ is the radiative efficiency for a QSO radiating at a fraction $L/LEdd$ of the Eddington luminosity. Commonly accepted values of these two key parameters for luminous QSOs are $\epsilon= 0.1$ and $L/LEdd = 1$. 
Martini, P. (QSO Lifetimes; http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004cbhg.symp..169M). 

This critical accretion rate, [the Eddington mass accretion rate], is proportional to the mass of the accreting object, which implies that the mass of an object that is growing at the maximal (Eddington) accretion grows exponentially on a timescale known as the Salpeter time,
\begin{equation}
  t_{Sal} = \frac{\epsilon \sigma_{T} c}{4\pi G m_{p}} \approx 45 \epsilon_{0.1} 10^6 \, {\rm years}
\end{equation}
from ``Massive Black Hole Growth and Formation'' from Paolo Coppi. 
%%tSal = εσT c ≈ 45ε0.1106 years, (1) 4πGmp


\subsection{Soltan Argument}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\epsilon}{1-\epsilon} \, \rho_{\rm BH} c^{2} = \int e(z) (1+z) dz
\end{equation}
$e(z) dz$ : present energy density from AGN in redshift range $z$ to $z+dz$.\\
$\rho_{\rm BH}$: mean cosmic density of nuclear black holes.\\
$\eta$: radiative efficiency\\
The Soltan argument works approximately for $\eta\approx$0.1, 
so observed AGN must account for most of nuclear black hole growth.

\section{T} 
\subsection{Thomson cross-section}
$N_{\rm H} \geq \sigma_{\rm T}^{-1} \simeq 1.5 \times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. 
%http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March04/Comastri/Comastri1.html

For an electron:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\rm T}= \frac{8\pi}{3} \left(\frac{\alpha\hbar c}{mc^2}\right)^2 = 0.6652\times10^{-24} \,\, \rm{cm}^{-2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Thomson scattering} 
%%http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_scattering
Thomson scattering is the elastic scattering of electromagnetic radiation by a free charged particle. It is just the low-energy limit of Compton scattering: the particle kinetic energy and photon frequency are the same before and after the scattering. This limit is valid as long as the photon energy is much less than the mass energy of the particle: $\nu\ll mc^2/h$.
