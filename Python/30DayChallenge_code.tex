\section{Day 4: Class vs. Instance}
\begin{lstlisting}
'''
Objective:

In this challenge, we are going to learn about the difference between a class and an instance; because this is an Object Oriented concept, it is only enabled in certain languages. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task: 
Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

yearPasses() should increase the age  instance variable by 1.

amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
   If age< 13 , print You are young.
   If >= 13 and age < 18, print You are a teenager.
   Otherwise, print You are old.

To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, much of the code is provided for you, but you''ll be writing everything in the future. The code that creates each instance of your Person class is in the main method. Dont worry if you dont understand it all quite yet!
'''

class Person:
    def __init__(self,initialAge):
        # Add some more code to run some checks on initialAge
        self.age = 0
        if initialAge < 0:
            print ("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.")
        else:
            self.age = initialAge
            
    def amIOld(self):
        # Do some computations in here and print out the correct statement to the console
        if age < 13:
            print("You are young.")
        elif 13 <= age < 18:
            print("You are a teenager.")
        elif age >= 18:
            print("You are old.")

Objective:: Today, we are learning and practicing an algorithmic concept called Recursion. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task:: Write a factorial function that takes a positive integer, N, as a parameter and prints the result of N! 

Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of 0.

Input Format: A single integer, N (the argument to pass to factorial).

\section{Day 12: Inheritance}
\begin{lstlisting}
'''
Objective:: Today, we are delving into Inheritance. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task:: You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.

Complete the Student class by writing the following:
A Student class constructor, which has  parameters:
A string, firstName.
A string, lastName.
An integer, id.
An integer array (or vector) of test scores, scores.

A char calculate() method that calculates a Student object''s average and returns the grade character representative of their calculated average. 


Sample Input:: 
Heraldo Memelli 8135627

\section{Day 13: Abstract Classes}

\begin{lstlisting}
'''
Objective:: Today, we are taking what we learned yesterday about Inheritance and extending it to Abstract Classes. Because this is a very specific Object-Oriented concept, submissions are limited to the few languages that use this construct. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task:: Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:
-- Inherits from Book

-- Has a parameterized constructor taking these  parameters:
   -- string title
   -- string author
   -- int price
   
Implements the Book class abstract display() method so it prints these 3 lines:
 1. Title,  a space, and then the current instances title. 
 2. Author, a space, and then the current instances author. 
 3. Price,  a space, and then the current instances price.

Note: Because these classes are being written in the same file, you
must not use an access modifier (e.g.: ) when declaring MyBook or your
code will not execute.

Input Format:: You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The Solution class creates a Book object and calls the MyBook class constructor (passing it the necessary arguments). It then calls the display method on the Book object.

Output Format:: The void display() method should print and label the respective, title, author and price of the MyBook objects instance (with each value on its own line) like so:
Title:     $title
Author: $author
Price:     $price
Note: The $ is prepended to variable names to indicate they are placeholders for variables.

Sample Input::
The following input from stdin is handled by the locked stub code in your editor:
The Alchemist
Paulo Coelho
248
'''

from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod

class Book(object, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    def __init__(self,title,author):
        self.title=title
        self.author=author   
    @abstractmethod
    def display(): pass

class MyBook(Book):
    price = 0
    def __init__(self, title, author, price):
        super(Book, self).__init__()
        self.price = price 

    def display(self):
        print("Title: "+ title)
        print("Author: "+ author)
        print("Price: "+ str(price))

\section{Day 14: Scope}
\begin{lstlisting}
"""
Objective:: Today we're discussing scope. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is written as |a-b|. The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, elements, is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in elements.

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array (elements) for storing N non-negative integers, and a public integer (maximumDifference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

Task:: Complete the Difference class by writing the following:
-- A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the  instance variable.

-- A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any  numbers in  and stores it in the  instance variable.

Input Format:: You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The locked Solution class in your editor reads in 2 lines of input; the first line contains N, and the second line describes the elements array.

Sample Input::
3
1 2 5

Sample Output::
4
"""
class Difference:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.__elements = a
# Add your code here
    def computeDifference(self):
        self.maximumDifference = abs(max(self.__elements) - min(self.__elements)) 
# End of Difference class

##
##  NOTE TO NPR: The indentation really had to be correct here!!
##  aka, you kinda really need to understand these Classes a bit better!!
##

"""
Your constructor must save the argument passed as its integer array parameter to the integer array instance variable (). 

The computeDifference method must then access the the integer array instance variable () and find its maximum and minimum elements. Once these are found, the method must save their absolute difference to the  instance variable. 

Note: The use of Math.abs is not really necessary. Because the problem constraints stipulate that we are only dealing with positive numbers,  will always be positive.
