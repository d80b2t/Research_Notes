\section{Day 4: Class vs. Instance}
\begin{lstlisting}
'''
Objective:

In this challenge, we are going to learn about the difference between a class and an instance; because this is an Object Oriented concept, it is only enabled in certain languages. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task: 
Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

yearPasses() should increase the age  instance variable by 1.

amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
   If age< 13 , print You are young.
   If >= 13 and age < 18, print You are a teenager.
   Otherwise, print You are old.

To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, much of the code is provided for you, but you''ll be writing everything in the future. The code that creates each instance of your Person class is in the main method. Dont worry if you dont understand it all quite yet!
'''

class Person:
    def __init__(self,initialAge):
        # Add some more code to run some checks on initialAge
        self.age = 0
        if initialAge < 0:
            print ("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.")
        else:
            self.age = initialAge
            
    def amIOld(self):
        # Do some computations in here and print out the correct statement to the console
        if age < 13:
            print("You are young.")
        elif 13 <= age < 18:
            print("You are a teenager.")
        elif age >= 18:
            print("You are old.")
        
    def yearPasses(self):
        # Increment the age of the person in here
        global age   #NPR: don't quite undesrstand what global does here...
        age += 1

t = int(input())

\section{Day 5: Loops}
\begin{lstlisting}
'''
Objective: 
In this challenge, we are going to use loops to help us do some simple math. Check out the Tutorial tab to learn more.

Task 
Given an integer, , print its first  multiples. Each multiple  (where ) should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.
'''
import sys

N = int(input().strip())

for ii in range(1, 11):
    print (N,'x', ii ,'=', N*ii)
